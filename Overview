In my first week of learning python via W3S. I covered the following material. 
-Syntax
-Comments
-Variables
-Data
-Numbers
-Casting
-Strings
-Booleans
-Operators
-Lists
-Tuples
-Sets
-Dictionaries

This gave me a secure foundation on the basics of the language. I even started creating my own things and detoured of the tutorials confidently. 
Wk 1 was defenitely a great week in terms of python productivity and learning.
